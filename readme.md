<table>
	<tr><th>Abstract</th></tr>
	<tr><td>This plugin detects repetitive attempts to POST to a given website resource. This is a sign of trouble for your website, as it may be an attempt to gain unauthorized access via weak user credentials. Further attempts are temporarily blocked until a specified blackout period has expired.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

Attempts to circumvent your website's authorization process are a fact of life.
Detecting and dealing with them are necessary. One common hacking method is
simple brute force trial and error. When a series of unsuccessful requests to
login occurs in a short period of time, this plugin will add the user-agent's
remote address to a blacklist: subsequent requests to login will be blocked with
status code `403 Forbidden`.

Sometimes a legitimate user may trigger this detector and accidentally lock
themselves out. For this reason, the blackout is automatically removed after a
given period of time.

Often these cracking attempts will be routed through a botnet, where each
request comes from a large collection of different IP addresses.  For those
types of attacks, you can set the `max-visits` variable to a low value, to detect
and block attempts aggressively.

In order to monitor the usefulness of this plugin you can enable the `log-failures`
configuration switch. When `true` the IP address of each blocked request will be
printed to the website's log.

#### Customization

This plugin is open source and can be modified or enhanced to perform tasks such
as these:

   * Permanently block IP addresses that request a *honeypot* resource.
   * Redirect a blacklisted user via `303 See Other` to a customer service help page.
   * Detect *botnet thunderstorms* and automatically increase threshold sensitivity.

### Download

The plugin module is available from <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/rwserve-brute-force'>NPM</a>
. Before proceeding, you should already have `Node.js` and `RWSERVE` configured and
tested.

This module should be installed on your web server in a well-defined place, so
that it can be discovered by `RWSERVE`. The standard place for public domain
plugins is `/srv/rwserve-plugins`.

<pre>
cd /srv/rwserve-plugins
npm install rwserve-brute-force
</pre>

### Configuration is Everything

Make the software available by declaring it in the `plugins` section of your
configuration file. For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the <a href='https://rwserve.readwritetools.com/plugins.blue'>plugins</a>
documentation on the `Read Write Tools HTTP/2 Server` website.

#### TL;DR

<pre>
plugins {
    rwserve-brute-force {
        location `/srv/rwserve-plugins/node_modules/rwserve-brute-force/dist/index.js`
        config {
            max-visits      5
            grace-period    300
            blackout-period 900
            log-failures    true
        }
    }
    router {
        `/rbac/credentials/*`   *methods=POST      *plugin=rwserve-brute-force
    }    
}
</pre>

The `config` settings can be adjusted using this guidance.

`max-visits` is a positive integer. This is the number of requests to the target
resource allowed during the grace period before being blocked. A typical setting
might be 3 to 6, while an aggressive setting would be 1.

`grace-period` is an integer number of seconds specifying a window of time during
which requests are counted. The counter for each IP address is reset to zero
when this much time has elapsed since the first request. If the counter exceeds
the max-visits threshold, a blackout is begun.

`blackout-period` is an integer number of seconds specifying the window of time
during which all requests to the target resource, by the blacklisted IP, are
blocked. When this time period has elapsed, the IP address is removed from the
blacklist and subsequent requests are honored, starting with a new grace period.

`log-failures` is a switch that may be either <kbd>true</kbd> or <kbd>false
</kbd>. If true, each request by an IP address during a blackout period is recorded in
the web log. If false, blackouts are silently enforced without recording to the
web log.

The `router` section lists one or more target resources that will participate in
the brute force scheme. In the above example, all HTTP `POST` requests for
resource paths beginning with `/rbac/credentials` will participate.

#### Cookbook

A full configuration file with typical settings for a server running on
localhost port 7443, is included in this NPM module at `etc/brute-force-config`.
To use this configuration file, adjust these variables if they don't match your
server setup:

<pre>
$PLUGIN-PATH='/srv/rwserve-plugins/node_modules/rwserve-brute-force/dist/index.js'
$PRIVATE-KEY='/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key'
$CERTIFICATE='/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt'
$DOCUMENTS-PATH='/srv/rwserve/configuration-docs'
</pre>

### Usage

#### Server

Start the server using the configuration file just prepared. Use Bash to start
the server in the background, like this:

<pre>
[user@host ~]# rwserve /srv/rwserve-plugins/node_modules/rwserve-brute-force/etc/brute-force-config &
</pre>

#### Forcing a blackout

Use CURL to submit a sequence of POST requests to your sever. The first five
requests will return with `403 Forbidden` with a response header `rw-rbac-forbidden`
indicating that invalid credentials were provided. The sixth and subsequent
requests will return `403 Forbidden` without any supplemental header. Close
examination of the server's logged messages will reveal something like `error RwserveBruteForce RA=127.0.0.1; CT=6`
indicating the remote address (RA) and count (CT) for the blocked request.

<pre>
curl -X POST -d "action=login&user=root&password=toor" https://localhost:7443/rbac/credentials/login -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded -H content-length:36 -v
curl -X POST -d "action=login&user=admin&password=adm" https://localhost:7443/rbac/credentials/login -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded -H content-length:36 -v
curl -X POST -d "action=login&user=debug&password=dbg" https://localhost:7443/rbac/credentials/login -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded -H content-length:36 -v
curl -X POST -d "action=login&user=setup&password=123" https://localhost:7443/rbac/credentials/login -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded -H content-length:36 -v
curl -X POST -d "action=login&user=devops&password=me" https://localhost:7443/rbac/credentials/login -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded -H content-length:36 -v
</pre>

#### Deployment

Once you've tested the plugin and are ready to go live, adjust your production
web server's configuration in `/etc/rwserve/rwserve.conf` and restart it using `systemd`
. . .

<pre>
[user@host ~]# systemctl restart rwserve
</pre>

. . . then monitor its request/response activity with `journald`.

<pre>
[user@host ~]# journalctl -u rwserve -ef
</pre>
